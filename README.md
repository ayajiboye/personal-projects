P1 - Classmates tracker: This program was written because I had an idea and I was curious to see how to implement it. I am currently taking a data structures class this semester and between that class and some of the others I'm taking, I've been seeing so many familiar faces. I was wondering if there was a way to know all the people who I have two or more classes in common with and that was how this project was born.

P2 - Todo list: Yes, everyone makes a todo list, but I had to do it. It was necessary to show off my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming, Java syntax, data structures, user input handling, and error handling.

P3 - Basic finance tracker: This program allows users to input transactions as either income or expenses and calculates the current balance. The transactions are stored in an ArrayList, and the balance is updated accordingly. After the user decides to quit by typing 'quit,' the program displays all transactions and the final balance. It is still very basic, but I'll enhance it by add a feature to categorize expenses, save the data to a file, and maybe eventually add a GUI.

P4 - Text editor: This program is a text editor built using Java Swing. It provides basic text editing functionalities like creating new documents, opening existing files, editing their content, and saving changes. The user interface includes a text area for typing and editing text, along with a menu bar that contains options for opening, saving, and creating new files. Actions like opening and saving files are handled through dialog boxes that allow users to select files on their computer. The text editor is capable of handling plain text files, making it suitable for simple text editing tasks.
